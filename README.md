# VoteChain
A Decentralized e-Voting Portal based on Ethereum Blockchain. 
### Procedure
-> Initiate Ganache and set it up to operate on the designated port specified in the "truffle-config.js" file.
-> Proceed to compile the contracts by entering the command: "truffle compile."
-> Once you have completed the Ganache operations, run the npm server. To do this, navigate to the project directory and enter the following command in your terminal: "npm run dev."
-> After executing the above code, the server will start on your machine, allowing you to switch to your browser.
-> In your browser's URL window, type "localhost:[port number]," where the port number is provided in your terminal when you run the server. This will display the hosted web page.
-> Now, configure Metamask by syncing it with Ganache to access dummy Ethers for testing purposes.
-> You are now ready to make a selection from the available options in the list for casting your vote. Click on the final submit button.
-> A final pop-up from Metamask will appear, prompting you to confirm the transaction. Click "Confirm," and congratulations, your vote has been successfully cast.
